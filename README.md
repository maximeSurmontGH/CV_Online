# CV_Online

Angular JS

Please find here a template for your cv online. You can, ofc, also use it offline and just print it.

So first you will have to change the picture : go in /img, delete me.jpg and put in ths directory your own picture called me.jpg. If your picture is  not .jpg, you will have to change in /cv/cv.template "me.jpg" (just search it, it whould be in a img balise) by "me.xxx".

Second Step will be to change the data of the file info.json. Be careful to follow, exactly the syntax or you won t be able to get your data. In the part "contact", just change my data by yours. In the other sections you can add as much as you want elements. All depends on how many skills you have, your hobbies,.. It tooks time but once it s done you will be able too change your resume very easily.

Third part is to change the color, if you want. For now, there sis nothing done to help it but you jist have to go in the file /css/contentCv and change the filed starting by "#". Here is a tips: search an element "#xxxx" with ctrl+f and select them, pick a color and change all selected elements by this color. This way you will update quickly the template and keepthe design safe.
