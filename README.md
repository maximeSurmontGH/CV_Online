Please find here a template for your cv online. You can, ofc, also use it offline and just print it in PDF.

First Step will be to change the data of the file info.json. Be careful to follow exactly the syntax or the call to get your data won't work. In the part "contact", just change my data by yours (to change the picture by one of yours, just go in the folder img, delete me.png and put there your own picture (also called me.png, or you will have to change the me.png in th Json file)). In the other sections you can add as much as you want elements. All depends on how many skills you have, your hobbies,.. It tooks time but once it s done you will be able too change your resume very easily.

Second step is to change the color, if you want. For now, there sis nothing done to help it but you jist have to go in the file /css/contentCv and change the filed starting by "#". Here is a tips: search an element "#xxxx" with ctrl+f and select them, pick a color and change all selected elements by this color. This way you will update quickly the template and keepthe design safe.
